# 0x0.st
[0x0.st](https://0x0.st/) is a command line file uploading service. this batch file is a small program that will make uploading much more intuitive and easier. link(s) will copy to your clipboard when job is finished. [0x0.st](https://0x0.st/) is not a service provided by me, I made this to make things faster for me. This sort of acts as A Gui for 0x0.st, it shows progress on the file upload % with a progress bar. You can also select multiple files and send to, it will still work
